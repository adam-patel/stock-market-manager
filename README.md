# Stock Market Portfolio Manager

Practising TDD while creating something that's actually useful...

# Mission

Create a simple stock market portfolio ledger on which retail traders can record buys and sells and keep track of profit and loss.
All the user should have to do is enter trade information when they open or close a position. The rest is dealt with programmatically.

This git is a continuation of this, when I started this project a couple of days ago.
